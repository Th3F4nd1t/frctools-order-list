          FRCTools is a hobby project and does not collect data which can be
          used to directly identify you. There is no intention of collecting
          data for the purpose of being sold.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, some data collection is required for the site to function.
          </p>
        <p>
          This data includes: IP addresses, usernames, emails, hashed and salted
          password, names, and any other data explicitly entered into the
          website. FRCTools Orders is hosted on Cloudflare, with a database
          hosted on Planetscale. Further privacy information can be found on
          each's respective websites.

          For analytics purposes, FRCTools Orders makes use of Plausible
          Analytics (self hosted) to track privacy friendly web analytics. All
          tracked information remains only with me. A list of the data tracked
          by Plausible can be found on their website. If you would not like to
          be tracked, block the possible.grahamsh.com domain on your
          device/network. If you would like your account or organization
          deleted, please contact me at support@frctools.com.
