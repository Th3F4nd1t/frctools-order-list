# Organizations

Organizations in FRCTools Orders allow teams to collaborate on order management together.

## What is an Organization?

An organization represents your FRC team or any group that needs to collaborate on orders. Key features:

- **Shared orders** - All organization members can view and manage orders
- **Team management** - Invite and manage team members
- **Role-based access** - Control what members can do
