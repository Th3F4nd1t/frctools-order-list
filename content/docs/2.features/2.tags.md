# Using Tags

Tags help you organize and categorize orders for easy filtering and management.

## What are Tags?

Tags are customizable labels that you can apply to orders. Each tag has:

- A **name** - Descriptive label (e.g., "Electronics", "Mechanical", "Urgent")
- A **color** - Visual identifier for quick recognition

Tags are organization-specific, meaning each organization has its own set of tags. Only organization **admins** and **owners** can create and manage tags.

## Creating Tags

To create a new tag:

1. Open [Organization Settings](/organization)
2. Open the **Tags** tab
3. Click <UButton color="primary" icon="i-lucide-plus" size="xs">New Tag</UButton>
3. Enter a **name** for the tag
4. Choose a **color**
5. Click **Create tag**

::tip
Use colors strategically - by making them visually distinct and meaningful, you can quickly identify and categorize orders at a glance.

## Applying Tags to Orders

When creating or editing an order:

1. Look for the **Tags** field
2. Click to open the tag selector
3. Select one or more tags to apply

## Filtering by Tag

Use tags to quickly find related orders:

1. Use the tag filter dropdown at the top of the order table
2. Select one or more tags to filter by

Only orders with the selected tags will be displayed.

## Deleting Tags

To delete a tag:

1. Go to the Tags management area in [Organization Settings](/organization)
2. Click on the tag to edit
3. Click <UButton color="error" variant="subtle" icon="i-lucide-trash" size="xs">Delete</UButton>
4. Confirm the deletion

::warning
Deleting a tag will remove it from all orders. This action cannot be undone.

## Tag Best Practices

Here are some suggestions for organizing tags:

### By Subteam

- `Electronics`
- `Mechanical`
- `Programming`
- `Carpentry`

### By Priority

- `Urgent`
- `High Priority`
- `Nice to Have`

### By Subsystem

- `Drivetrain`
- `Intake`
- `Shooter`
- `Climber`

### By Status

- `Mentor Approved`
- `Awaiting Approval`

::tip
Start with a small set of tags and add more as needed. Too many tags can make filtering less effective.
